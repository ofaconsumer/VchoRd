# VchoRd
## A chording keyboard for VR.

VchoRd is basically one of my VR-related brainchilds. It was created out of spite because I cannot prevent myself from yelling while playing Gorilla Tag.

It's still under construction, but I will have an early version with a limited number of words available soon.
